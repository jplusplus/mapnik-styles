# mapnik-styles
This repository contains custom styles for use with the Mapnik map rending engine, and Open StreetMap data. Mapnik can be used to create static maps, or tiles for slippy maps. These styles require an PostGIS database with Open StreetMap data to render. The repo comes with some complimentary  shapefiles, some of which have unclear licences. The repo is therefore private.
